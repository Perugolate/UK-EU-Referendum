# UK EU Referendum Voting Data

The results of the 2015 UK General Election are finally in and have revealed an unpredicted 52% vote to leave the EU, causing the value of the pound to fall over 10% reaching its lowest levels in over 30 years as the country enters a period of uncertainty.

 * Region name
 * Number of votes to leave
 * Number of votes to remain
